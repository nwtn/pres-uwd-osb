# Universal Web Design: How to create an awesome experience for *every* user

Open Source Bridge,  
2015-06-24

> We all strive to create a great experience for our users. HTML5, CSS3, and modern JavaScript frameworks give us more power to design beautiful, immersive sites than we’ve ever had before. But this power must be wielded responsibly — too often our modern design and development practices leave behind users that don’t have the devices, network speed, or physical abilities that our sites demand.
>
> By using Universal Web Design — including principles of accessibility, web performance, progressive enhancement, and responsive web design — you can make sure all your users get the great experience they deserve.
>
> In this talk, I will describe how Universal Web Design principles can be easily applied to new or existing sites, how these principles will improve your users’ experience, and how Universal Web Design will save you time and money.
